### Actual Info

I make games with [@AndyyyYuuu](https://github.com/AndyyyYuuu) (go visit him he has candy) and we post them on our [itch.io](https://blue-square.itch.io/) profile.

There are also a number of AI projects here. Much of the code is copied and some of it might not work (yet) but yeah.
